1. "serde": This dependency is used for serializing and deserializing data. It will be shared across all files for data handling.

2. "reqwest": This is a high-level HTTP client library. It will be used in "src/api.rs" for making API requests and in other files if they need to make HTTP requests.

3. "solidity": This is a library for generating Solidity code. It will be used in "src/solidity_generator.rs" and any other file that needs to generate Solidity code.

4. "llm": This is a library for the LLM (Low-Level Machine) language. It will be used in "src/llm.rs" and any other file that needs to use LLM.

5. "llm-chain": This is a library for the LLM-chain. It will be used in "src/llm_chain.rs" and any other file that needs to use the LLM-chain.

6. "language_parser": This is a library for parsing language into code. It will be used in "src/language_parser.rs" and any other file that needs to parse language.

7. "tokio": This is a Rust runtime for asynchronous programming. It will be used in "src/main.rs" and any other file that needs to use asynchronous programming.

8. "uuid": This library is used for creating UUIDs. It will be used across all files for generating unique identifiers.

9. "cargo_toml": This library is used for parsing and manipulating Cargo.toml files. It will be used in "Cargo.toml" and "Cargo.lock".

10. Function Names: "parse_language", "generate_solidity", "run_llm", "run_llm_chain", "main". These function names will be shared across multiple files as they represent the core functionality of the application.

11. Message Names: "ParseError", "GenerationError", "LlmError", "LlmChainError". These message names will be used across multiple files for error handling.

12. Data Schemas: "LanguageInput", "SolidityOutput", "LlmState", "LlmChainState". These data schemas will be used across multiple files for data handling.

13. Exported Variables: "API_URL", "SOLIDITY_VERSION", "LLM_VERSION", "LLM_CHAIN_VERSION". These exported variables will be used across multiple files for configuration.
